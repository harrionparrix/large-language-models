# Language Model Training with Transformers

This repository contains code for training a Language Model using the Hugging Face Transformers library. The model is based on the GPT-2 architecture and is trained on custom text data.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the required dependencies installed by running:

```bash
pip install transformers
```

### Data Preparation

Before running the code, ensure you have your text data prepared. In this example, the data is loaded from a file named `shakes.txt`. You can replace it with your own dataset.

### Training the Model

Run the training script to train the GPT-2 Language Model:

```bash
python train_model.py
```

The training script initializes the GPT-2 tokenizer and model, sets the training parameters, and trains the model on the specified text data.

### Training Parameters

Adjust the training parameters in the script to suit your requirements:

- `train_batch_size`: Batch size for training.
- `num_train_epochs`: Number of training epochs.
- `learning_rate`: Learning rate for optimization.

### Save the Trained Model

The trained model and tokenizer are saved to the `./results/` directory. You can change the output directory by modifying the `output_dir` variable in the script.

## Usage

Once the model is trained, you can use it for text generation or other natural language processing tasks. Load the trained model using the following code:

```python
from transformers import GPT2Tokenizer, GPT2LMHeadModel

tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained('path/to/trained/model')
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained('path/to/trained/model')

# Example usage
input_text = "Once upon a time"
input_ids = tokenizer.encode(input_text, return_tensors='pt')
output = model.generate(input_ids)
decoded_output = tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

print(decoded_output)
```

Replace `'path/to/trained/model'` with the path to your trained model.
